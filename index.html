                <h2>Personal profile</h2>
                <p>
                    I am 25 years old and I come from Crete, Greece. 
                    I have a BSc degree in Biology at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. 
                    I am currently a second-year international MSc student in the Master’s in Bioinformatics at the 
                    department of Science of Copenhagen University (KU).
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my Bachelor’s studies, I focused on bioinformatics, biostatistics, data mining 
                    and subsequent analyses used in the field. During the first year of my MSc I chose courses 
                    to increase my knowledge in statistics and machine learning as well as their application in 
                    biology and more specifically genomics.
                </p>
                <h2>Work Experience</h2>
                <h3>Academic Research Assistant</h3>
                <p>
                    I am currently employed as an academic research assistant in the Brunak group in the Center 
                    for Protein Research (CPR). The group focuses on Translational Disease Systems in Biology, and
                     I am a member of the genetics infrastructure sub-group which focuses on the development of software 
                     which is used by the rest of the group. My major projects up to this point have been:
                     <ul>
                        <li>
                            Development of an in-house PheWAS-pipeline, along with a local-browser application which 
                            visualizes the results post-analysis to aid data exploration. The software utilizes 
                            patient gentic data along with patient health records classified in the form of both 
                            ICD-10 and PheCodes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Use of large genetic cohorts such as the Danish Blood Donor Study and Copenhagen 
                            Hospital Biobank to find associations between patients’ genetic background 
                            and covid-19 severity after infection.
                        </li>
                     </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>Teaching Assistant at UCPH</h3>
                <p>
                    After my first year of MSc studies, I applied for and became a teaching assistant 
                    for the courses that I had previously taken and was enthusiastic about. 
                    This choice was derived from my interest in sharing my enthusiasm with others on topics that fascinated 
                    me, but also an indirect goal was developing my abilities to explain complex concepts as efficiently as possible. 
                    The courses that I chose were:
                </p>
                <table>

                <h2>Education</h2>
                <h3>University studies</h3>
                <h3>Internship at the Hellenic Center of Marine Research</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I worked for 2 months at the Hellenic Center of Marine Research in Crete, Greece and focused on developing 
                        a pipeline used for mining long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) from a pool of transcriptomics data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The lncRNAs found were examined later to check whether they contributed or not on gender 
                        determination for each species.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Erasmus+ internship</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I completed a six-month long internship at the Turku University in Finland, where along with my supervisor 
                        Spiros Papakostas worked on a genomics-transcriptomics project from start to finish.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The project focused on locating islands of genomic inversions using custom pipelines that I wrote myself. 
                        The goal was to connect those aforementioned islands with genetic divergence between 
                        three different species of a rotifer organisms.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        With the help of my supervisor we are planning on publishing the results on a scientific journal.
