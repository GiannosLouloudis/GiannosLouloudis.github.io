### **Personal profile**

I am 25 years old and I come from Crete, Greece. 
I have a BSc degree in Biology at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.
I am currently a second-year international MSc student in the Master’s in Bioinformatics at the department of Science of Copenhagen University (KU).

During my Bachelor's studies, I focused on bioinformatics, biostatistics, data mining and subsequent analyses used in the field. During the first year of my MSc I chose courses to increase my knowledge in statistics and machine learning as well as their application in biology and more specifically genomics. 

Since the first semester of my Master's studies I have been working as an academic research assistant in the Brunak group in the Center for Protein Research (CPR). During the second year of my MSc I also started working as a Teaching Assistant for Programming and Data Science courses at KU.

### **Work experience**

I am currently employed as an academic research assistant in the Brunak group in the Center for Protein Research (CPR). The group focuses on *Translational Disease Systems in Biology*, and I am a member of the *genetics infrastructure sub-group* which focuses on the development of software which is used by the rest of the group. My major projects up to this point have been:

    - Development of an in-house PheWAS-pipeline, along with a local-browser application which visualizes the results post-analysis to aid data exploration. The software utilizes patient gentic data along with patient health records classified in the form of both ICD-10 and PheCodes.
    - Use of large genetic cohorts such as the Danish Blood Donor Study and Copenhagen Hospital Biobank to find associations between patients' genetic background and covid-19 severity after infection.
